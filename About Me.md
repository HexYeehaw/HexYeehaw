~ Hi, I’m Evan! I am a high school student that does streaming, music and art as a side passion. My pronouns are he/they!


~ I’m interested in video games such as Apex Legends, Minecraft, The Sims 4 and 3, Detroit: Become Human, Resident Evil 2, 3, 4, 7 and Village, along with many many others!


~ I am also interested in horror, whether it is a film to artwork. I enjoy drawing traditionally and digitally and to pair with the art, I enjoy music.


~ I’m currently learning guitar, vocals, more complex art and creating 3d models.


~ I’m looking for people to talk to with help for either of these things, and I would love to have friends to talk to!


~ How to reach me? My business email is poisoned.evan@gmail.com and you can ask for my discord if you want to call.

I am currently on hiatus from streaming to catch up with high school! I am making an avatar during my free time for it, though.
